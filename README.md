Cansat Aether consists of 4 members called Mattias, Fran, Timon and Jules. We will be participating in the Cansat 2022/2023. (https://cansat.esa.int/)
We will be trying to achieve a guided cansat using an advanced parachute. Our system can be controlled by adjusting the length of the parachute cords to create an uneven force of air resistance. This allows the cansat to stabilize and steer itself. This system is light, inexpensive and simple. One potential application is a space probe that wants to study the air layers of a gas giant. On these gas giants, there are strong eddies. This system could stabilize the space probe in a lightweight way that does not require additional fuel. Our system provides the ability to steer the space probe to potentially interesting places or away from objects or uneven terrain.
